<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi! I am Chrystie Tiong, a 13-year old student from<a href="http://www.dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg">Dunman High School</a>, Singapore.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>My hobby is playing basketball when I'm free and socialising with my friends.I like playing basketball as it keeps me fit and I can also release stress.
Socialising with my friends allows me to know more about them and not be so anti-social, always on phones.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I am doing <a href="http://codein.withgoogle.com">Google Code-in 2016</a> with <a href="http://fossasia.org">FOSSASIA</a>!</p>
